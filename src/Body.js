                Hi, I'm Robinson Regalado and I am a Flatiron School Software Engineering graduate. I enjoy developing cool websites, playing with new technologies and sharing my vision.
                <br/> Over the past 5 years, I have been working in the legal industry at both small boutique to global law firms as a Litigation Knowledge Management Specialist. My desire to learn how to code comes from my work in the industry as I found there could be many ways to improve the efficieny of the resources law firms maintain by introducing and building new software. 
                <br/> I have been trained as a full stack software engineer and have worked with technologies such as Rails, Python, JavaScript, React, Graphql and Postgres. Below you can check out some of my projects!
